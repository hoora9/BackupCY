2.  Implement complex animations using GSAP and CSS scroll-driven animations.
3.  The design must be professional, modern, and adhere to the provided brand book and user-specified styles.
4.  Content and assets are provided iteratively and must be implemented precisely.
5.  The site should be responsive and visually polished.

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page React frontend application with all data managed in  and all styles in . The site consists of a Homepage, Company, Mission, Expertise, Services, and Manifesto pages. The Impact page has been deleted.

Recent major changes include:
-   **Expertise Page**: The team section was updated (member removed, photos changed, LinkedIn links added). The values section was completely redesigned from an animated reveal to a static 3x2 bento box grid.
-   **Services Page**: The right-hand video section was replaced with a static text block. The accordion content was updated and is now closed by default.
-   **Manifesto Page**: The layout was changed to a single solid background color, with text content refactored into bento boxes and an image fade-out effect added on scroll.
-   **Headers**: A standardized header style () has been applied across multiple pages (Manifesto, Expertise, etc.) to ensure a consistent look for titles with emblems.
-   **Contact Page**: The form was updated to include two new dropdown menus and remove the phone number field.
-   **Impact Page**: The page was completely removed from the router and navigation.

*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was implementing a multi-part user request which involved: deleting the phone number on the Contact page, adjusting the background color on the Expertise page's bento boxes, fixing an emblem position on the Mission page, and transforming the Manifesto page's text into bento boxes with a scroll-fade effect for images.
*   **Status**: BLOCKED
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: manual testing by screenshot tool

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   Issue 1: Fix CSS syntax error blocking frontend rendering (P0)

**Issues Detail**:
*   **Issue 1: Fix CSS syntax error blocking frontend rendering**
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent attempted to take a screenshot after applying new CSS changes but received an error, indicating a syntax issue in the CSS file.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  The error occurred after editing  (specifically in messages #503-505).
        2.  Review the recently added styles for  in  to find and correct the syntax error.
        3.  After fixing the error, perform a full visual verification of all changes from user message #483:
            *   **Contact Page**: Confirm the phone number is removed.
            *   **Expertise Page**: Confirm the teal background is only inside the value bento boxes.
            *   **Mission Page**: Confirm the closing emblem is positioned lower, below the MISSION heading.
            *   **Manifesto Page**: Confirm text paragraphs are now styled as bento boxes.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: The frontend is currently broken. Fixing this is critical to unblock all further development and verification.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: No. This is the highest priority blocker.

**In progress Task List**:
*   There are no in-progress tasks. The current focus is on fixing the critical bug.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   Implement Scroll-to-Top on Page Navigation (P2). This is a standard UX improvement that was requested earlier but has been deferred.
    *   Verify the image fade-out scroll effect on the Manifesto page after the CSS bug is fixed (P2).
*   **Future Tasks**:
    *   A backend will be needed to make the contact form functional (P3).
    *   Implement a 3D text animation on the Services Page (P3).

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Expertise Page Overhaul**: Replaced the values animation with a static bento grid, updated team members and photos, added LinkedIn links, and adjusted layout and background colors.
-   **Services Page Redesign**: Replaced the video section with formatted static text and set the accordion to be closed by default.
-   **Manifesto Page Refactor**: Changed the layout to a single color, converted text sections into bento boxes, and implemented an image fade-out effect on scroll.
-   **Impact Page Deletion**: Removed the page completely from the application's routes and navigation menu.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None. The agent has been addressing issues as they arise or as prioritized by the user.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The Expertise page Values section had a layout bug where content was cut off.
*   **Recurrence count**: 1
*   **Status**: RESOLVED. The section was completely redesigned into a bento grid, which inherently fixed the previous scrolling/layout problem.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, JSX, React Router
-   **Styling**: A single monolithic  file with advanced CSS, including Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties, pseudo-elements (, ), and keyframe animations.
-   **Animation**: GSAP (ScrollTrigger), CSS Animations.
-   **Data Management**: All site content is centralized in a single JavaScript object in .

**key DB schema**
-   N/A. This is a frontend-only application with mocked data.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : **CRITICAL**. Contains the syntax error that is currently breaking the application. It has been heavily modified to support all recent UI changes.
-   : Layout updated to use bento boxes for text content.
-   : Layout changed to have background color only in bento boxes.
-   : CSS class for emblem alignment was modified.
-   : Phone number field and icon were removed.
-   : Route for the deleted  page was removed.
-   : Navigation link for the  page was removed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : This file is extremely large and difficult to manage. It is the primary source of maintenance overhead and bugs (like the current one). It should be broken down into page-specific or component-specific CSS Modules.
-   **Component Logic**: Reusable patterns, like the  header, have been implemented with page-specific overrides. These could be refactored into a more robust, reusable component with variants.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **IMPERATIVE FIRST STEP**: Your first task is to fix the CSS syntax error in . The frontend is currently broken. The error was introduced while styling the manifesto bento boxes (messages #502-505).
-   The user provides extremely specific and frequent feedback. Always prioritize the user's most recent request.
-   The  page has been permanently deleted. Do not attempt to work on it.
-   The styling for headers with emblems has been standardized under the  class. Pay attention to this pattern when making header changes.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.

*   N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent is currently blocked by a self-induced bug. It has not forgotten any user requests but was unable to complete verification of the last set of changes. Long-term tasks from the original project scope (like scroll-to-top) remain pending due to the high volume of iterative UI requests from the user.</analysis>
